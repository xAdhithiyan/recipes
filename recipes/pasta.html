            <p>Pasta fazool is classic Italian American comfort food. This recipe works with any sausage, 
                but I like the fennel and anise flavors of sweet Italian sausage with the beans. A hearty soup that's fast and easy to put together.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>12 ounces sweet bulk Italian sausage</li>
                <li>½ yellow onion, chopped</li>
                <li>¼ cup tomato paste</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>3 cups chopped Swiss chard</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Add diced celery and chopped onion. Cook until onions are translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Add dry pasta; cook and stir for 2 minutes. </li><br/>
                <li>Stir in tomato paste until evenly distributed, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in 3 cups broth; increase heat to high and bring to a boil. Stir in red pepper flakes, oregano, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat to medium and let simmer, stirring often, for about 5 minutes. Add more broth if needed. </li><br/>
                <li>Place chopped chard in a bowl. Cover with cold water and rinse leaves; any grit will fall to the bottom of the bowl. Transfer chard to a colander to drain briefly; add to soup. Cook and stir until leaves wilt, 2 to 3 minutes. </li><br/>
                <li>Stir in white beans; continue cooking and stirring until pasta is tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in grated cheese. Serve topped with additional grated cheese. </li><br/>
